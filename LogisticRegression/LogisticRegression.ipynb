    "Logistic regression is similar to linear regression except it predict weather something is true or false instead of predicting something continous like size. Instead of fitting a line to the data, logistic regression fits an \"S\" shaped \"logistic function\". The curve goes from 0 to 1. It is usually used for classification. "
